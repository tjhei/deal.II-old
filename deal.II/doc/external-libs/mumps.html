    <h1>Interfacing <acronym>deal.II</acronym>
      to <acronym>MUMPS</acronym></h1>

    <p>
      <a href="http://mumps.enseeiht.fr" target="_top">MUMPS</a>
      should be readily packaged by most Linux distributions.
      Don't forget to install a develpment version of the library.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is a detailed instruction on how to compile and install
      <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> and some of its dependencies by hand (for
      the case you wish to do so).
    </p>

    <h2>How to compile and install <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> by hand</h2>

    <p>
      In the following, we describe the compilation process of
      <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> and its dependencies starting
      with <acronym>BLACS</acronym> and following with
      <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym>.

      The compilation of <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> and its dependencies
      is not as straightforward is we would like, however, it is not
      so difficult that we can not talk about it. That said, we cannot
      discuss every possible choice of parameters, because this is too
      involved (and we would probably much rather be doing something
      productive with the interface and <acronym>deal.II</acronym>). Thus
      we give only a short walk-through mentioning the most important
      parameters needed for successful compliation and linking.
    </p>

    <p> The compilation scheme involves repeating the same three steps
      for each piece of software we want installed: (i) Selecting an
      appropriate makefile; (ii) Modifying symbols in this makefile to
      suit the environment; and (iii) running make to actually compile
      the software.
    </p>

    <p> Note: If you are using a system, which provides
      Intel's <acronym>MKL</acronym>, you should only have to compile
      <acronym>MUMPS</acronym>, since <acronym>BLACS</acronym> and
      <acronym>SCALPACK</acronym> are already included in the
      <acronym>MKL</acronym>. Therefore you can jump directly to
      section 3, where the compilation of <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> is
      considered. Otherwise start right below with the installation
      of <acronym>BLACS</acronym>.
    </p>

    <h3>1. BLACS</h3>

    <p> The <a target="_top" href="http://www.netlib.org/blacs/">BLACS</a> library
      provides basic linear algebra routines together with a
      communication model such that they can be used in parallel. The
      compilation of this library is highly dependent on the system
      and software used and we can only give a general guide through
      the configuration process.
    </p>

    <p> The library can be found on the
      official <a target="_top" href="http://www.netlib.org/blacs/">BLACS
	webpage</a>. We require the three
      files <b><code>mpiblacs.tgz</code></b>,
      <b><code>mpiblacs-patch03.tgz</code></b>, and
      <b><code>blacstester.tgz</code></b>. After extraction of these
      three files <i>in the same directory</i>, we find a subfolder
      named <code>BMAKES</code> in that directory. Inside this
      subfolder there are lots of different Bmake-files for
      different architectures. The naming of the files are
      conventional: <code>Bmake.XXX-YYY</code>,
      where <code>XXX</code> stands for the message passing software
      of your system
      (<i>e.g.</i> <acronym>MPI</acronym>, <acronym>PVM</acronym>)
      and
      <code>YYY</code> for the system architecture (<i>e.g.</i> LINUX,
      SUN4, SUN4SOL). Pick the corresponding file for your combination
      of message passing software and system architecture, copy it to
      the root directory of <acronym>BLACS</acronym>, and rename it
      <code>Bmake.inc</code>. Now that we have the correct makefile,
      we have to adapt it to the system we are using.
    </p>

    <p> We start by opening Bamke.inc in our favourite text editor and
      taking a look at the following three sections:

      <ul>
	<li> In <code>SECTION 1: PATHS AND LIBRARIES</code> set the
	  MPI environment correctly by changing the
	  variable <code>MPIDIR</code> to the directory, where your
	  <acronym>MPI</acronym> installation is located
	  in. Furthermore you will probably have to adjust the
	  variables <code>MPILIBdir</code>,
	  <code>MPIINCdir</code> and <code>MPILIB</code>.
	</li>

	<li> In the section <code>SECTION 2: BLACS INTERNALS</code>
	  the most important variables are <code>INTFACE</code> and
	  <code>TRANSCOMM</code>. If you are using OpenMPI, then set
	  these as follows: <code>INTFACE = -DAdd_</code>
	  and <code>TRANSCOMM = -DUseMpi2</code>. Otherwise, consult
	  the
	  <a ref='http://www.netlib.org/blacs/BLACS/Install.html'>BLACS
	    webpage</a> for details on how to set these values
	    correctly.
	</li>

	<li> The last section is named <code>SECTION 3:
	    Compilers</code>. Here we set the
	    variables <code>F77</code> and <code>CC</code> to
	  correspond to the <acronym>MPI</acronym> Fortran and CC
	  compiler respectively, <i>e.g.</i>
	  <code>mpif77</code> and <code>mpicc</code>. An important
	  issue here are the variables <code>F77FLAGS</code>
	  and <code>CCFLAGS</code>. It is absolutely vital to add the
	  flag <code>-fPIC</code> to both of them, otherwise it will
	  not be possible to link <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with the
	  <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library correctly when shared
	  libraries are enabled.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> Assuming we have done all of that correctly, we go back to
      the <acronym>BLACS</acronym> root directory and compile the
      library with the command <code>make mpi</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>2. SCALAPACK</h3>

    <p> The <a target="_top" href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack">SCALAPACK</a>
      library provides high-performance linear algebra routines for
      distributed-memory message-passing <acronym>MIMD</acronym>
      computers. The library can be found on the
      official <a target="_top" href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack">SCALAPACK
      webpage</a>. We require the
      file <b><code>scalapack.tgz</code></b> version &lt;= 1.8.0 only.
    </p>

    <p> After extracting the file and changing to the directory which
      was created, we find a file
      called <code>SLmake.inc.example</code> and rename it
      to <code>SLmake.inc</code>. In this file we have to set a few
      parameters as we did before with <acronym>BLACS</acronym>'
      own <code>Bmake.inc</code>.

      <ul>
	<li> The first important variable is the
	  variable <code>home</code>. Here you have to take care, that
	  this points to the <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym> directory
	  (<i>i.e.</i> where you are right now). Next, the variable
	  <code>BLACSdir</code> points to the directory, where your
	  <acronym>BLACS</acronym> libraries are located. Then set the
	  variable <code>SMPLIB</code> to the <acronym>MPI</acronym>
	  library.
	</li>

	<li>Now we have to get <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym> to know
	  about the location of the <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library,
	  which we installed first. This is done by editing the
	  following bunch of variables <code>BLACSFINIT</code>,
	  <code>BLACSCINIT</code>, and
	  <code>BLACSLIB</code>.

	  <ul>
	    <li> <code>BLACSFINIT</code> has to point to your
	      F77init-library of <acronym>BLACS</acronym>. Check the
	      name of the <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library file
	      containing <code>F77init</code> in its name and put in
	      this name here;
	    </li>
	    <li> <code>BLACSCINIT</code> has to point to
	      the <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library file
	      containing <code>Cinit</code> in its name;
	    </li>
	    <li> Finally, <code>BLACSLIB</code> points to the remaining
	      <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library file.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</li>

	<li> Next we set the compilers correctly
	  again. <code>F77</code> and <code>CC</code> should point to
	  your <acronym>MPI</acronym> Fortran and CC compiler
	  respectively. Also at this place we have to add the
	  flag <code>-fPIC</code> to the <code>F77FLAGS</code> and to
	  the <code>CCFLAGS</code>. To the variable <code>CDEFS</code>
	  you have to add the value of the
	  variable <code>INTFACE</code> in the configuration
	  file <code>Bmake.inc</code> in <acronym>BLACS</acronym>.
	</li>

	<li> Finally, we should check that the variables
	  named <code>BLAS</code> and
	  <code>LAPACK</code> point to your <acronym>BLAS</acronym>
	  and <acronym>LAPACK</acronym> libraries compiled on your
	  system.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> If all variables are set correctly we can go ahead and compile
      the <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym> library with the
      command <code>make</code>.
    </p>

    <h3>3. MUMPS</h3>

    <p> Now we come to the main program for which we are doing all
      this. We want to install the parallel sparse direct
      solver <a target="_top" href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS">MUMPS</a>.
    </p>

    <p> After downloading the solver from its
      official <a target="_top" href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS">webpage</a>,
      extracting it, and changing to the directory which was created, we
      find a subfolder named
      <code>Make.inc</code> where there are bunch of different
      Makefiles for different machine architecture. Here it is
      important to realize that for each architecture there are two
      different files &mdash; one with the ending <code>.SEQ</code>
      and one without. The makefiles with the extension
      <code>.SEQ</code> are the ones required for the sequential
      version of MUMPS. Since we want to use <acronym>MUMPS</acronym>
      in parallel, we take the file
      <i>without this extension</i> which looks suitable for the
      architecture we are building on and copy this into
      the <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> root directory and rename it
      as <code>Makefile.inc</code>.
    </p>

    <p> As before, we open the makefile <code>Makefile.inc</code> in
      our favourite text editor and start modifying variables:

      <ul>
	<li> The first variables we have to edit are the compilers
	  again. As usual the variable <code>CC</code> should point to
	  your <acronym>MPI</acronym> CC
	  compiler, <i>e.g.</i> <code>mpicc</code>. The
	  variables <code>FC</code> and <code>FL</code> should both
	  point to your <acronym>MPI</acronym> Fortran90 compiler,
	  <i>e.g.</i> <code>mpif90</code>.
	</li>

	<li> Now let us consider the
	  variable <code>SCALAP</code>. This one should point to your
	  <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym>0 and <acronym>BLACS</acronym>
	  installations as follows:
	  <code>-L/XXX -lscalapack -L/YYY -lblacs -lblacsCinit
	    -lblacsF77init -lblacs -lblacsCinit</code>;
	    where <code>XXX</code> stands for the directory containing
	    the <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym> library
	    and <code>YYY</code> for the directory containing the
	    <acronym>BLACS</acronym> library.  The
	    variable <code>INCPAR</code> should point to
	    the <acronym>MPI</acronym> include directory.
	</li>

	<li> Now we turn to the variable <code>LIBPAR</code> which
	  should contain the same value as the
	  variable <code>SCALAP</code> plus a pointer to
	  the <acronym>MPI</acronym> library. Therefore we propose to
	  set it to the following value: <code>$(SCALAP) -L/XXX
	  -lmpi</code>, where <code>XXX</code> stands for the
	  directory containing your <acronym>MPI</acronym>
	  libraries. Please check, if the
	  variable <code>LIBBLAS</code> points to your BLAS
	  installation. The variable
	  <code>CDEFS</code> has to contain the same value as the variable
	  <code>INTFACE</code> of
	  <acronym>BLACS</acronym>' own <code>Bmake.inc</code>. If you
	  are using OpenMPI this should be the
	  value <code>-DAdd_</code>.
	</li>

	<li> Finally we add the flag <code>-fPIC</code> to the
	  three compiler flag variables <code>OPTF</code>,
	  <code>OPTC</code>, and <code>OPTL</code> which follow
	  immediately after the above. Without adding this last flag it
	  will not be possible to link <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with
	  <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> as a shared library.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we are done with configuration and can
      compile <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> with the
      command <code>make</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Linking with deal.II</h2>

    <p>
      Support for <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> will be enabled automatically
      if a system wide installation of <acronym>MUMPS</acronym>
      can be found.  To use a self compiled version, specify
      <pre>

    -DMUMPS_DIR=/path/to/mumps
      </pre> on the command line when invoking <code>cmake</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <acronym>SCALAPACK</acronym> and <acronym>BLACS</acronym> a hint
      - if necessary - may be given by
      <pre>

    -DSCALAPACK_DIR=/path/to/scalapack
    -DBLACS_DIR=/path/to/blacs
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      You can override the autodetection by manually specifying
      <pre>

    -DDEAL_II_WITH_MUMPS=OFF|ON
      </pre>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> Throughout this description of the compilation process
      of <acronym>MUMPS</acronym> we have emphasised adding the compiler
      flag <code>-fPIC</code>. This is a definite requirement if we
      are compiling <acronym>deal.II</acronym> with shared libraries
      (which is the default). If we had preferred to be compiling
      <acronym>deal.II</acronym> without shared libraries, that's ok too;
      in that case we would do exactly the same thing as described above,
      but this time omitting the <code>-fPIC</code> flag from the scheme.
    </p>
