Description of the C++ class hierarchy for the
accessor classes

  <strong> Wolfgang Bangerth, 1998, 1999, 2000</strong>
</p>


<p>
The class hierarchy of the accessor classes used to retrieve and store
data in the triangulation and degree of freedom handler objects is one
of  the more complicated parts of  the library. It  makes heavy use of
class templates with  integers  as template parameters  as  well as of
explicit specialization  of classes and  member functions.  Therefore,
it is not so  easy to  see the  connections and  inheritance relations
within this part of the class tree; this  document tries to shed a bit
of light onto this.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it lists the member functions that can be queried to
obtain information from an iterator.

<H3>
What iterators and accessors are
</H3>

<p>
When  using  adative finite elements,   the data structures  often are
extremely complex, requiring   multiply indirected access  and complex
relationships between  the different places  where data is stored. The
traditional way  to  handle this is  to  put  all  data which  belongs
together somehow into  a structure or  object; however, sometimes this
can  not  be done  efficiently,    leading  to either higher    memory
consumption (when you have to store many small data pieces and because
you have to store a lot of pointers to other objects) or higher coding
requirements (when you want to follow all those pointers to the object
you desire).
</p>

<p>
Therefore, we took  over a concept  which was already  used in the C++
standard template library, namely iterators and accessors. An accessor
is an object that looks like if it  had all the information stored but
really only delegates the access to the right  places; in fact, within
this library, accessor store almost  no information but know where  to
get   everything   from the complex  and   nested  data structures the
triangulation object offers. They have a simple interface which allows
to     extract any desired   information   from  the triangulation and
therefore makes access  much easier and safer in  three ways: first it
performs range and parameter checking  when in debugging mode; second,
it encapsulates the access to the real data  from the user, hiding the
true data structures and thus allowing  them without changing the user
programs as well as those parts of the  library which only act through
accessors; and third by reducing the coding  errors because of reduced
complexity, since the chains of indirect access are replaces by simple
commands.
</p>

<p>
Iterators are a  related concept: while  accessors act as if they were
structures with data contained in them, iterators act  as if they were
pointers pointing to   accessors. You can  dereference  them using the
-&gt; and * operators  as with any  other pointer, but they have  more
functionality. Essentially, they  have overloaded ++ and -- operators,
which  allow the next  or previous object  pointed to to be just about
anywhere  in memory. A good introductory  example are the iterators of
the STL  <CODE>list&lt;T&gt;</CODE> class, which  act on a linked list
as if it  were a contiguous  array. The  iterators in  this library go
even a step further: they do not point to different objects but rather
tell  the   associated  accessor   object which   data   to  look   at
next.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, there  are different  versions  of the   iterators which
behave  differently   when  being  incremented or   decremented: while
<I>raw</I> iterators let the  associated accessor point  to any of the
objects it   is  made for,  <I>normal</I>  iterators   always point to
objects which are in use.  Usually, you will not want  to see cells or
lines which are there but are unused by the triangulation (these cells
are  somewhat like  holes in  the   arrays of the triangulation;  such
things happen  when unrefining a cell,  the freed memory  is then kept
for a while  because of better efficiency), so  you will  almost never
want to use raw iterators;  they are mostly there  for internal use in
the    library. Normal iterators are   almost  like raw iterators, but
whenever you call the ++  or -- operator,  the  look at what they  are
pointing at  and skip all unused  elements by increasing or decreasing
the pointer as often as necessary to reach the next used object.
</p>

<p>
Finally,    there are <I>active</I>  iterators,    which are the  most
important ones. They  are  like normal   iterators but  only point  to
active cells or lines.  By active we  mean that they have no children;
in  the context in which this  library is used,  this is equivalent to
the  fact   that   we  do  computations   on these   cells,   lines or
whatever. Active iterators  are normal iterators  which  skip over all
non-active cells, lines, etc when being incremented or decremented.
</p>



<a name="tria-accessors"></a>
<H3>
The triangulation accessor hierarchy
</H3>

<p>
The triangulation accessors are used to retrieve and store data in the
triangulation.  There  exist accessors  for  lines  in one and  higher
dimensions, accessors for  quads in two  and higher dimensions, and so
on. The general naming scheme is as follows:
<ul>
<li> <code>TriaAccessor&lt;dim&gt;</code> is a general base class
     which is of not much interest.
<li> <code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;objectdim,spacedim&gt;</code> denotes
     an accessor for an object with dimension
     <code>objectdim</code> in a <code>spacedim</code> dimensional
     space. It is derived from <code>TriaAccessor&lt;spacedim&gt;</code>.
<li> <code>CellAccessor&lt;dim&gt;</code> presents the special
     properties that a cell has. It is therefore derived from
     <code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;spacedimdim,spacedim&gt;</code>.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Their inheritance trees in the different space dimensions therefore
look like this:
</p>

<p>

<hr>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="3d-tria.jpg" ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="80%"> 
</CENTER>
<p>

<hr>

<p>
Some of the data is only  useful if an object is  a cell. For example,
neighborship is only accessible for cells,  while faces (e.g. lines in
2D) can't access their neighbors (neither the  adjacent cells, nor the
other   faces it touches).    Therefore, the CellAccessor classes  are
derived from whatever  object a cell  is in the respective  dimension,
i.e. from lines  in 1D, from quads  in 2D,  and  so on. 
</p>



<a name="tria-typedefs"></a>
<H4>
Typedefs of the Triangulation class to iterators and accessors
</H4>

<p>
The <CODE>Triangulation<1></CODE> class declares the following data
types which involve accessors:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <1,CellAccessor<1> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <1,CellAccessor<1> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<1,CellAccessor<1> > active_line_iterator;

    typedef    raw_line_iterator    raw_cell_iterator;
    typedef        line_iterator        cell_iterator;
    typedef active_line_iterator active_cell_iterator; 
</PRE>
Since lines are cells in one space dimension, all line iterators are
cell iterators as well.
</p>

<p>
In two space dimensions, the following types are declared by the
<CODE>Triangulation<2></CODE> class:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <2,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 2> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <2,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 2> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<2,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 2> > active_line_iterator;
    
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <2,CellAccessor<2> >    raw_quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <2,CellAccessor<2> >        quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<2,CellAccessor<2> > active_quad_iterator;

    typedef    raw_quad_iterator    raw_cell_iterator;
    typedef        quad_iterator        cell_iterator;
    typedef active_quad_iterator active_cell_iterator;

    typedef    raw_line_iterator    raw_face_iterator;
    typedef        line_iterator        face_iterator;
    typedef active_line_iterator active_face_iterator;    
</PRE>
Since in this space dimension, quads are cells and lines are the faces
of  cells, the  appropriate face  and  cell iterators  are declared in
terms of the underlying accessor types.
</p>


<p>
In three space dimensions, the following types are declared by the
<CODE>Triangulation<3></CODE> class:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <3,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 3> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <3,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 3> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<3,TriaObjectAccessor<1, 3> > active_line_iterator;
    
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <3,TriaObjectAccessor<2, 3> >    raw_quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <3,TriaObjectAccessor<2, 3> >        quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<3,TriaObjectAccessor<2, 3> > active_quad_iterator;

    typedef TriaRawIterator   <3,CellAccessor<3> >    raw_hex_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <3,CellAccessor<3> >        hex_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<3,CellAccessor<3> > active_hex_iterator;

    typedef    raw_hex_iterator    raw_cell_iterator;
    typedef        hex_iterator        cell_iterator;
    typedef active_hex_iterator active_cell_iterator;

    typedef    raw_quad_iterator    raw_face_iterator;
    typedef        quad_iterator        face_iterator;
    typedef active_quad_iterator active_face_iterator;    
</PRE>
Since in this space dimension, hexes are cells and quads are the faces
of  cells, the  appropriate face  and  cell iterators  are declared in
terms of the underlying accessor types.

<a name="dof-accessors"></a>
<H3>
The degree of freedom accessor hierarchy
</H3>

<p>
The DoFAccessor classes    provide access to  the   degree  of freedom
information associated  with  cells,   lines, etc.   The   inheritance
relationship is much the    same  as for the   triangulation  accessor
classes, as can  be seen from the  following  pictures.

<hr>

<IMG SRC="3d-dof.jpg" ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH="80%">

<p>

<hr>

<p>
The main difference to the triangulation accessor hierarchy is that we
want the DoF accessors to provide the information about the degrees of
freedom, but for convenience also that of the triangulation. This way,
we can get all the information from one object rather than needing two
which  work in  parallel, and  the  class hierarchy  shown above  does
exactly this.
</p>

<p>
For the named reason, it is necessary to derive the
<code>DoFObjectAccessor&lt;1,dim&gt;</code> from the
<code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;1,dim&gt;</code> class of the
triangulation accessor hierarchy, as well as the
<code>DoFObjectAccessor&lt;2,dim&gt;</code> from the
<code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;2,dim&gt;</code>. However, we would also
like to include the functionality added by the CellAccessor class;
this is done through some template magic: when in one space dimension,
the <code>DoFObjectAccessor&lt;1,1&gt;</code> is derived from
CellAccessor&lt;1&gt;, while when in higher dimensions, it is derived
from <code>DoFObjectAccessor&lt;1,dim&gt;</code>; the same applies for
the <code>DoFObjectAccessor&lt;2,dim&gt;</code> class.  Note that this
way, CellAccessor is always a base class to DoFCellAccessor and the
inheritance lattice is dimension dependant; the exact way of achieving
this is complicated but not of interest here.
</p>


<a name="dof-typedefs"></a>
<H4>
Typedefs of the DoFHandler class to iterators and accessors
</H4>

<p>
The typedefs done by the DoFHandler class are much alike those done by
the Triangulation class. They could be summarized as follows:
</p>

<p>
For one space dimension:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <1,DoFCellAccessor<1> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <1,DoFCellAccessor<1> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<1,DoFCellAccessor<1> > active_line_iterator;

    typedef    raw_line_iterator    raw_cell_iterator;
    typedef        line_iterator        cell_iterator;
    typedef active_line_iterator active_cell_iterator; 
</PRE>
Since lines are cells in one space dimension, all line iterators are
cell iterators as well.
</p>

<p>
For two space dimensions:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <2,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 2> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <2,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 2> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<2,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 2> > active_line_iterator;
    
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <2,DoFCellAccessor<2> >    raw_quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <2,DoFCellAccessor<2> >        quad_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<2,DoFCellAccessor<2> > active_quad_iterator;

    typedef    raw_quad_iterator    raw_cell_iterator;
    typedef        quad_iterator        cell_iterator;
    typedef active_quad_iterator active_cell_iterator;

    typedef    raw_line_iterator    raw_face_iterator;
    typedef        line_iterator        face_iterator;
    typedef active_line_iterator active_face_iterator;    
</PRE>
</p>

<p>
For three space dimensions:
<PRE>
    typedef TriaRawIterator   <3,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 3> >    raw_line_iterator;
    typedef TriaIterator      <3,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 3> >        line_iterator;
    typedef TriaActiveIterator<3,DoFObjectAccessor<1, 3> > active_line_iterator;

    typedef TriaRawIterator   <3,DoFObjectAccessor<2, 3> >    raw_quad_iterator;

<h4>Functions offered by degree of freedom accessors</h4>

<p>
Since degree of freedom accessors are derived from triangulation
accessors, they inherit the functionality of these accessors, but add
some of their own. We only list the additional functionality
below. For a full reference, including data types of parameters and
return values, please refer to the general
<a href="../../auto/kdoc/dof/index.html" target="body">API
documentation of the `DoF' classes</a>.
</p>


<dl>
  <dt><em>
  dof_index (dof_number)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Return the global index of one of the DoFs on this object.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  set_dof_index (dof_number, index)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Set the index of a DoF. Only for internal use.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  vertex_dof_index (vertex_number, dof_number)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Return the index of one of the DoFs on one of the vertices of this
  object.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  set_vertex_dof_index (...)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Set the vertex DoF index. Only for internal use.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  get_dof_indices (vector_of_indices)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Return a vector of the indices of the DoFs on this object.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  get_dof_values (global_values, local_values)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Extract and return the values of the DoFs on this object from a data
  vector defined on all DoFs.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  set_dof_values (local_values, global_values)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Reverse operation: take values of DoFs on this object, and set them
  into a global data vector.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  distribute_local_to_global (local_source, global_destination)  
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Add the elements of local_source, defining values of the degrees of
  freedom on this object, to the elements of the global data
  vector. The two parameters may be either vectors or matrices.
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  get_interpolated_dof_values (global_values, local_interpolation)
  </em></dt>

  <dd>
  Interpolate the global field to this cell. If this cell is active,
  then this is the restriction of the global field to this cell,
  but when this cell is not active then it is the interpolation of the
  restriction of the field to the child cells and the interpolation to
  the present one. (For cell iterators only.)
  </dd>


  <dt><em>
  set_dof_values_by_interpolation (local_values, global_interpolation)
  </em></dt>
  
  <dd>
  Inverse operation: interpolate the local values to the children (if
  this cell is not active) and set the respective values in the global
  vector. (For cell iterators only.)
  </dd>
</dl>
