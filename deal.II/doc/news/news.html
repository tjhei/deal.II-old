          <strong>2013/12/18: step-26 for the heat equation </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-26 fills a long-standing gap: There was no tutorial
          program solving the heat equation. There was also no tutorial
          showing in relatively easy terms how to do adaptive meshes
          in time dependent problems. This program fills both of these
          needs.

          <strong>2013/11/01: step-42 solves an elasto-plastic contact problem </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-42, written by J&ouml;rg Frohne, Timo Heister and Wolfgang
          Bangerth, shows how to solve an elasto-plastic contact problem.
          The program is an extension of step-41 to a much more complex
          equation (nonlinear elasto-plasticity) and also demonstrates
          how to compute solutions for such problems in parallel.

          <strong>2013/10/01: step-51 implements an HDG method </strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-51, contributed by Martin Kronbichler and Scott Miller,
          implements a hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method for the scalar
          convection-diffusion equation. The method uses standard DG terms for
          describing the element interior but couples the local sub-problems
          using face elements. The local contribution is eliminated from the
          global linear system by a static condensation process.

      </dt>
      <dd>
          deal.II version 8.0 was released today. This is a major new
	  release, featuring the conversion of the configuration and
	  build system to <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>,
	  support for parallel computations with more than 4 billion
	  unknowns, and many more. A full list of changes can be

          <strong>2013/06/05: 64-bit version of deal.II</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Because the global dof index variables in deal.II were of type
	  unsigned int, it was not possible to create a dof_handler with more than
	  4.3 billions of unknowns. The 64-bit version of deal.II uses unsigned long
	  long int and thus, allows for 18e18 unknowns.

      <dt>
          <strong>2013/03/07: Build system switched to CMake</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          After having used Autoconf as the configuration and build system
	  since the beginning of deal.II in 1997, we have now switched to
	  <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>. This implementation,
	  contributed by Matthias Maier of Heidelberg University, has taken
	  more than half a year, consists of more than 10,000 lines, and
	  touches every aspect of the installation process. It provides a more
	  modern interface to and more reliable way of interacting with other
	  packages. Furthermore, it no longer relies on shell scripts and
	  therefore integrates more easily with integrated development
	  environments as well as Microsoft Windows without Cygwin.

        <strong>2012/06/06: step-43 &mdash; an efficient solver for
        two-phase flow</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The step-21 tutorial program was the first program in the
        deal.II tutorial to demonstrate the solution of two-phase flow
        problems, but it suffered from the fact that it was very
        slow. step-43 demonstrates some of the techniques that can be
        used to make solvers for such problems more efficient and
        accurate.
      </dd>


      <dt>
        <strong>2012/06/03: New step-15</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        Step-15 used to be a program that demonstrated techniques for solving
        a rather quirky, nonlinear, 1d problem. It was an interesting problem,
        but it served little purpose in teaching deal.II or in demonstrating
        nonlinear solution techniques. It has now been replaced by a more
        illustrative example, contributed in large part by Sven Wetterauer, in
        which we solve the nonlinear elliptic minimal surface equation using a
        Newton iteration.
      </dd>


      <dt>
        <strong>2012/05/05: Matrix-free implementation framework</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A matrix-free framework has been contributed by Katharina
        Kormann and Martin Kronbichler. The implementation is memory
        efficient and includes parallelism via MPI for distributed
        meshes, threads for shared-memory computations, and usage of
        processors' vector units. The two new tutorial programs step-37
        (multigrid solver) and step-48 (nonlinear wave equation with
        distributed grid) demonstrate the new features.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2012/04/02: step-44 &mdash; a finite strain
          elasticity solver</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-44, contributed by Andrew McBride and Jean-Paul
          Pelteret, demonstrates one approach to modelling large
          deformations of nearly-incompressible elastic solids. The
          elastic response is governed by a non-linear, hyperelastic
          free-energy function. The geometrical response is also
          nonlinear, i.e., the program considers finite deformations.
      </dd>


      <dt>
          <strong>2012/04/02: step-41 solves the obstacle problem</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-41, a program contributed by J&ouml;rg Frohne, shows
          how to solve the obstacle problem. This problem describes
          the deformation of a body subject to an inequality
          constraint that arises from the fact that the deformation is
          constrained by contact of the body with some external
          obstacle. The program uses the primal-dual active set method
          to solve this problem.

          convection solver</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Long in the making, the step-32 tutorial program
          demonstrates how to solve the Boussinesq equations
          describing thermal convection on large numbers of
          processors.

          <strong>2011/04/30: step-46 demonstrates coupling different models
          on different parts of the domain</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          step-46 shows how to couple different models defined on subsets of
          the domain, in this case Stokes flow around an elastic solid. The
          trick here is that variables (here the flow velocity and pressure,
          and the solid displacement) do not live on the entire domain, but
          only on a part. The point of the program is how to represent this in
          source code.

          Version 7.0.0 was released today. This release is a huge step
	  forward, with several significant new features such as support for

          The new step-38 program, contributed by Andrea Bonito and M. Sebastian
          Pauletti, shows how to discretize and solve partial differential
          equations posed on curved manifolds embedded in higher dimensional

        Contributed by Martin Steigemann, deal.II now has Qt based graphical
	user interface to edit input parameter files for
	the <code>ParameterHandler</code> class. The executable is located in
	<code>lib/bin/dealii_parameter_gui</code>.

      <dt>
          <strong>2010/10/25: New directory and library structure</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        deal.II has had a somewhat quirky directory and library structure for
        historical reasons, but this has now changed: All include and source
        files are now under the top-level <code>include/</code>
        and <code>source</code> directories. Furthermore, we no longer build a
        plethora of libraries but only <code>libdeal_II.g.so</code> (debug
        version) and <code>libdeal_II.so</code> (optimized version). In
	particular, we no longer build different versions of the library for
	different space dimensions.

      <dt>
          <strong>2010/10/23: Distributed mesh functionality available</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        After more than 2 years of work by Timo Heister, Martin Kronbichler,
	and Wolfgang Bangerth, and with help by Carsten Burstedde, we have
	merged a branch on which we have implemented the functionality
	necessary to distribute meshes on hundreds, thousands, or more
	processors. An overview of the framework
	in which this is implemented is presented in a documentation module,
	an accompanying paper, as well as in the new step-40 tutorial program.

          adaptively refined meshes with multigrid</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Using the MeshWorker framework, this program highlights the
          fact that loops over meshes are very generic and that
          building matrices and level matrices and evaluating error
          estimates are really the same task.

	<strong> 2010/06/24: The Meshworker framework has been released</strong>

      <dd>
	Using its generic loop and the provided auxiliary classes,

	loops over cells, faces, and subfaces, such that focus can remain
	on implementation of the local integrals.

          <strong>2010/02/13: New multigrid, new step-16</strong>
      </dt>
      <dd>
          Over the last few months, the multigrid implementation has seen
          significant rewrites, with much of the work done by B&auml;rbel
          Janssen. The goal &mdash; now achieved &mdash; was to finally fully
          support multigrid also for continuous finite elements on adaptively
          refined meshes (uniformly refined meshes and discontinuous elements
          have worked for a long time). As part of this process, step-16 has
          been rewritten and now solves the same problem step-6 solves, just
          with a multigrid solver.

          Based on work by Cataldo Manigrasso and Luca Heltai
          developed over the last few months on a branch, deal.II now
          supports meshes that are embedded in higher space
          dimensions. This allows, for example, to solve equations on

          Contributed by Moritz Allmaras, the <a

          explains how problems involving complex numbers can be treated in
          <acronym>deal.II</acronym>. In the example,
          the complex-valued solution to a Helmholtz equation is split into
          real and imaginary parts and a vector-valued finite element field
          is used to discretize them seperately. The program also demonstrates
          how quantities derived from the finite element solution can be directly
          included in the output by using the new <code>DataPostprocessor</code>
          class.
